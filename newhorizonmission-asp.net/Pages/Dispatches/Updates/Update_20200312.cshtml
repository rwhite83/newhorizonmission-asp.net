        The time has finally come, I'm going to start writing again. I've finished catching up my
        journal finally, I've done readings I needed to, but now I'm ready to write again. It was part talking
        to my uncle about his writing and being reminded how much it saddens me that I don't write anymore. It
        was also part my best friend's girlfriend publishing her book, and being quite sad the other night that
        I didn't really write anymore. She said but it's in your soul right? I said yeah, but my soul is dead.
        Well maybe not.

        But it's also been this thing that's been bugging me for a while. I just want to keep
        bulding out my New Horizons universe, but it is still saddled with launch being the required entry
        point. Every time I think about it now let alone read it I cringe. Having written so much more
        afterwards, and now at a point in my life where I feel much less self indulgent, I see it as a fatally
        flawed text.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        Perhaps mor importantly, I'm ready to take and accept real criticism about my work now in a
        way I wasn't before. This won't be 'my' story like Launch was, it will just be a good story. Criticism
        will still hurt because it always doesn, but it won't hurt so personally with this one, this time
        around.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        That's not to say I don't cherish them for what they are, and I certainly want the original
        Launch to always be around for those who are interested, who want to read my diversions into this and
        that which I was excited about at the time.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        But now having written a couple good stories, I really want to reshape Launch into something
        which is just a really good story, you know? I want to provide an easier on ramp for people to get into
        my universe. I will have to make changes to Midway for the same reason, but also to align continuity
        with what I wrote in the new version of Launch. I imagine I'll have to change little about Arrival
        though.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        Bottom line is, I wrote the version of Launch that was for <em>me</em>, now I'm going to
        write the version of Launch that is for everyone else
    </p>

        I want to get back into this universe. I can do this and the looking for coding work at the
        same time. This is an important part of my life. I want to do this rewrite of launch and the subsequent
        changes to Midway, polish to production quality, and publish physical and digital. I want to polish
        Reunion to production quality and publish physical and digital. I want to write an ending for Contact
        and do the rest for it as well, and then I want to write the sixth book and finish the second trilogy!
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead">
        I will do these things, because I enjoy it, because I enjoy my worlds. Because I live, then
        I have to write. Tonight I wrote the plot outline for the revised Launch. When I start writing I will
        post here and solicit comments after I code a comments section, cuz I can do that kind of thing now :P
    </p>

        The first chapter of the rewrite can be seen <a asp-area="" asp-page="/ChasingStars/Launch/Chapter01"
